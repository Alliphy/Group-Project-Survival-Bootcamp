            Ellen Ripley, a former Warrant Officer and commercial spacecraft
            pilot, has become a legend in the horror movie world. Her survival
            against the deadly Xenomorphs in the sci-fi horror film Aliens
            solidified her status as a fierce and resourceful hero. After her
            harrowing experience on LV-426, Ripley found herself haunted by the
            memories of the creatures she had faced. Driven by a desire to
            ensure others were prepared for such dangers, she founded
            Ripley&apos;s Survival Bootcamp. Her firsthand knowledge of the
            Xenomorphs and their tactics makes her uniquely qualified to train
            others in the art of survival.
